# Bungler is a stupid way to get java libraries from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/).

## Overview
Maven is not my favorite software, but it seems to have infected the Java world
making it damn near impossible to setup even the simplest of projects without
hours wasted just trying to find the right dependencies and setup something to
download them without covering yourself in the filth that is maven as a build
system. "I JUST WANT THE FUCKING JARS!" I usually scream after losing hours.

Bungler is just a thing to download the fucking jars.
